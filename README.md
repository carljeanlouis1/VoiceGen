# VoiceGen

VoiceGen is an advanced AI-powered web application that provides intelligent, interactive multimedia content creation, search, and audio generation using multiple AI models and APIs.

## Project Overview

VoiceGen combines the power of multiple cutting-edge AI models (OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Perplexity Sonar Pro) to create a versatile platform for text-to-speech conversion, AI-driven content creation, and AI-enhanced web search.

## Key Features

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Convert any text to high-quality speech using multiple voice options
- **Multi-Model AI Chat**: Interact with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, or Gemini 2.5 Pro 
- **AI-Powered Web Search**: Get comprehensive search results using Perplexity's Sonar Pro API
- **Podcast Creation**: Generate research-backed podcasts with "Arion Vale" persona, supporting multi-part episodes
- **Content Generation**: Create articles, stories, scripts, and more using AI with optional image analysis
- **Real-time Processing**: Progress tracking for long audio generation tasks
- **Personal Audio Library**: Save and manage your generated audio files
- **Background Processing**: Handle large text inputs up to 60 minutes of audio
- **Artwork Generation**: Create custom artwork for audio files

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- TanStack React Query for API data fetching
- Custom audio player with full playback controls

### Backend
